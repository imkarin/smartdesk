# Manual
Hello and welcome to my tech manual! This manual is a part of my IoT project: the Smart Desk â€” a connected standing-desk that helps the user stand up more regularly, based on his context, current activity and movement/fitness data.

In this manual you'll read how I realized one feature of the Smart Desk: looking at the user's movement activity, and turning it into "stand up!"-reminders if the user hasn't moved in a while.

Since we're working with multiple platforms, I've decided to split the code into four parts:

[1. Setting up the project in the Google API Console](https://github.com/karimeij/smart-desk/blob/main/manual/part-1.md)

[2. Fetching Google Fit data with Google Apps Script](https://github.com/karimeij/smart-desk/blob/main/manual/part-2.md)

[3. Using my Google Apps Script as an API ](https://github.com/karimeij/smart-desk/blob/main/manual/part-3.md)

[4. Fetching our API's data with the Arduino & turning it into output](https://github.com/karimeij/smart-desk/blob/main/manual/part-4.md)

Enjoy your read!
