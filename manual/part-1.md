# 1. Setting up the project in the Google API Console

*In this part of the manual we'll create a project in the Google API Console, connect it to the Google Fit API and make OAuth2 credentials for it ‚Äî so that the user can give it permission to their Google Fit data.* 


## Step 1: Creating a Google project for my application

First off, I went to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) and went to **IAM and management > Manage resources > Create project.**

## Step 3: Creating an OAuth Client ID

Lastly, I went to **Credentials > New credentials > OAuth Client ID.**

I selected "Webapplication" (since I was going to be fetching data from this API in Google Apps Script). I left everything else as default:

*That's it for this part of the manual! We created a Google Cloud project, connected it to the Google Fit API and gave it OAuth credentials. In the next part we'll [fetch the Google Fit data in a Google Apps Script. üëâüèª](https://github.com/karimeij/smartdesk/blob/main/manual/part-2.md)*
