# Smart Desk
More than 60% of adults in the United States don't get enough exercise in a day. Globally, especially since the lockdown of 2020, we've adopted a sedentary lifestyle that has negative consequences for our health. Some people try to do something about this by buying a standing desk, that they adjust manually. I think we can do better.

During my Internet of Things class [@cmda](https://github.com/CMDA), I came up with a concept for a connected standing desk: the Smart Desk. It's connected to your other smart home products & online accounts (like your fitness app) and uses this data to make you stand up more often and get rid of your sedentary lifestyle!
